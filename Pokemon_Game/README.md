#Pokemon Game
Pokedex is supposed to allow the user to create up to 151 pokemon and store them in a .txt file for future use. 
Every time you open the program the file is read into the program and you can search for and edit any pokemon that 
you like and then the file will be updated and you can access these modifications at a later date. The program takes 
a small range of user input and formats this input to a standard. Therefore the user does not have to worry about 
case sensitivity and spaces etc. The program also limits the input names to a range that is applicable to "Pokemon". 
If anything else is recieved then the user is prompted to try again and given some feed \back on the available 
options that the program is looking for.
